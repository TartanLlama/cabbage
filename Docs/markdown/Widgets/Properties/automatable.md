_____________________________
**automatable(val)** Default 1. Determines if a widget is automatable by a DAW host. Automatable widgets show up as plug-in parameters in the host. Non-automatable widgets still communicate with Csound but are not accessible by the host. Note that hosts don't allow this parameter to change dynamically -- the plugin will have to be reloaded for any changes to take effect.
