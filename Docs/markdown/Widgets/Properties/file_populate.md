**populate("filetype", "dir", ignoreVal)** Sets the type of file to search for, and the initial directory to look in. For example, to set the file type to wave files use "*.wav" as the filetype string. If using the `filebutton` to record parameter snapshots, you must specify a filetype of "\*.snaps", and a mode type of snapshot. If no directory is specified, the file browser will open in the current working directory. If the `ignoreVal` is set to 1 it will ignore the last known location and continue to open from the given directory. If set to 0, or left out completely, the `filebutton` will always open at the last directory the user browsed to.  

> You can also set the name of the custom preset file. Instead of passing "\*.snaps" as the file type, pass the full file name, i.e, "myPresets.snaps". Don't pass a full path here. Cabbage will automatically save and locate from the most suitable directory. Note that the same preset filename should be passed to all `filebutton` and `combobox` widgets involved in the management of the presets.
