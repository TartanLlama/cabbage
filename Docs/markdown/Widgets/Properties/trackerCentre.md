<a name="trackerCentre"><h3 style="padding-top: 40px; margin-top: 40px;"></h3></a>
_____________________________
**trackerCentre(val)** Sets where Cabbage will start drawing the tracker progress from. This is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 and 1 represent 6 o'clock. The default value is .9.

> This value should always be within the `trackerStart()` and `trackerEnd()` points. If not, your slider will look quite strange!
